## Creating a stake pool

### Prerequisites for stake pool operators

As a stake pool operator for Cardano, you will typically have the following abilities:

* operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Cardano node continuously
* a commitment to maintain your node 24/7/365
* system operation skills
* server administration skills (operational and maintenance).
* experience of development and operations (DevOps) would be very useful

**Hardware requirements**

In terms of hardware, you should have the following available:

* 8 GB of RAM
* 24 GB of hard disk space
* a good network connection and about 1 GB of bandwidth per hour
* a public IP4 address

Note that processor speed is not a significant factor for running a stake pool.

### Stake pool installation instructions

To learn how to set up your own stake pool, follow [installing the node from source instructions](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/getting-started/install.html).
