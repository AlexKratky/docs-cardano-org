## Getting Started with the Marlowe Playground
There are three options that you can choose from when using the Marlowe Playground. You can write directly in Marlowe text, but also use the visual Blockly visual programming tool to create contracts by fitting together blocks that represent the different components. 

Or you can choose to use either the embedded Haskell or Javascript editors to help you describe Marlowe contracts more readably and succinctly if you prefer. Once a contract is written, you can analyse its behaviour, such as checking whether any payments made by the contract could conceivably fail. You can also step through how a contract will behave, simulating the actions of the participants.
