Marlowe is designed to create the building blocks of financial contracts: payments to and deposits from participants, choices by participants, and real world information. 

Marlowe is a small language, with a handful of different constructs that, for each contract, describe behaviour involving a fixed, finite set of roles. When a contract is run, the roles it involves are fulfilled by participants, which are identities on the blockchain. Each role is represented by a token on the chain and roles can be transferred during contract execution, meaning that they can essentially be traded.
