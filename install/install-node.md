# Installing the Cardano node #

You can install the Cardano node using [pre-compiled executable files](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node#linux-executable/) for your platform. 

Alternatively, if you want to build the from source, there are two options available to you. Depending on your build tool preference, you can build from the source code using either: 
- [cabal: building the node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/install.md/)
- [Nix: building the node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/building-the-node-using-nix.md/)

Once you have installed the node, you need to [specify the configuration parameters](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/understanding-config-files.md/).
