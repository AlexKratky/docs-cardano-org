Getting started with Rosetta
The Rosetta API is made up of two core components; the Data API and the Construction API. Together, these APIs allow you to read and write to blockchains in a standard format over a standard communication protocol. The specifications for these APIs can be found in the rosetta-specifications repository.

For full details, read the Rosetta API specification.  For an overview of the interactions, view the Flow of Operations.
Developer Examples
This section outlines some examples that you can test out as a developer who wants to use Rosetta. However, we advise that you should exercise caution if testing these on mainnet.

Sample code for the typical Rosetta use cases:
Sending transactions
Staking key registration and delegation
Withdrawals
Sending transactions with single multi assets
