## Overview

Native Tokens is the name of Cardano's Multi-Asset (MA) support feature, which enables users to transact with ada, and an unlimited number of user-defined (custom) tokens natively.

Native support offers distinct advantages for developers: there is no need to create smart contracts to handle custom tokens, for example, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for manual errors since the ledger handles all token-related functionality.

The Native Tokens feature extends the existing accounting infrastructure defined in the ledger model (originally designed for processing ada-only transactions) to accommodate transactions using a range of assets. These assets include ada and a variety of user-defined custom token types.

Collecting Test Tokens
To get ada for testing in the pre-production environment, you will need to submit a request by filling out [this form](https://input-output.typeform.com/c/KmeBcnDa).

This method will be available for a limited time until a regular faucet is released.
