## Relevant Research Papers and Specifications

Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that aims to provide the community with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed. As a proof-of-stake blockchain, it is built with the rigor of high-assurance formal development methods and aims to achieve the scalability, interoperability, and sustainability needed for real-world applications. Cardano is the first platform to evolve out of scientific philosophy based on discovery, peer review, and cryptographic research. 

Building a strong foundation in the blockchain industry, Cardano has an ethos of openness and transparency. All the [research and technical specifications](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/) that underpin Cardano are publicly published and available to the community.

Cardano’s development roadmap is divided into 5 eras that focus on the foundation, decentralization, smart-contract and multi-asset ledger deployment, scalability, and governance of a pioneering blockchain environment. Relevant research papers and specifications according to the Cardano development roadmap are outlined below.

### Byron

A period dedicated to building a foundational federated network that enabled the purchase and sale of ada. The network ran the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus protocol.
