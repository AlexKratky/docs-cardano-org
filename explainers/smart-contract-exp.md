What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is an automated agreement, written in code, that tracks, verifies, and executes the binding transactions of a contract between various parties. The transactions of the contract are automatically executed by the smart contract code when predetermined conditions are met. 

Smart contracts are self executing and reliable and do not require the actions or presence of third parties. The smart contract code is stored on, and distributed across, a decentralised blockchain network, making it transparent and irreversible. 

In summary, smart contracts are immutable as a contract cannot be changed, they are distributable and tamper-proof, fast and cost effective, as there is no middle man which saves money and time, and is safe due to encryption.
