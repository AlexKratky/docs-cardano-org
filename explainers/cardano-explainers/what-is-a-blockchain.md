## What is a blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT), which provides a decentralized and accessible data structure of various records. Such records might include financial payment and transaction details, and all sorts of information – from commerce to internet of things (IoT) records.

Blockchain technology stores any type of data in a decentralized manner – being independent of centralized, controlling entities, or middle men. This provides enhanced means of transparent data storage and its management. An important feature of blockchain is that it stores records immutably, which means that they cannot be changed, forged, or deleted.  

Let’s take a closer look at existing solutions to understand the difference between these systems:

+ **Centralized systems**: all data entries and activities are usually managed using one central server. This increases the risk of a single point of failure, and also means that the controlling entity (such as banks or government institutions, for example) act as decision-makers.
+ **Decentralized systems**: generally rely on multiple server nodes, each of which serves a subset of the total end clients.
+ **Distributed systems**: all data and records of transactions are encrypted and stored not in one server, but in a system of interconnected, independent nodes and terminals. This ensures independence from centralized entities, transparency, and security. 

Blockchain can be compared to a book of permanent records, where every page acts as an information holder. Blockchain keeps data records in blocks, and just like book pages, these blocks are linked in a chronological order. No block can be erased or forged, as this will break the chain of records.

### Types of blockchains

Blockchains differ according to their permission settings. Generally, we can differentiate between:

+ **Public blockchains**. Public (or permissionless) blockchains are open-source and can be used without any limitations. Public blockchains are completely transparent and all participants have the read-and-write right access to its database to view relevant records or process transactions within the blockchain network. 
+ **Private blockchains**. Private blockchains are usually established for a predefined number of users, closed organizations, or specific projects. Such blockchains can solve a number of business problems relating to efficiency, security, or speed. Since managed data within such blockchains is kept private, it is possible to ensure a higher speed of transactions and scalability.
+ **Consortium blockchains**. Consortium blockchains function similarly to private ones. Only a predefined group of participants (usually more than one organization) can access and manage its databases. In contrast to private blockchains, consortium chains can keep certain data private or public. 
+ **Hybrid blockchains**. Hybrid blockchains combine private and public settings. Providing the features of both blockchain types, hybrid networks allow users to control who can access certain data.

Finally, blockchains not only provide an immutable and secure database but also act as a functional environment to transact funds, create digital currencies, and process complex deals using digital agreements (smart contracts).
