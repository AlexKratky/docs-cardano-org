## What is a cryptocurrency?

A *cryptocurrency* is a digital asset, which is cryptographically designed to serve as a medium of exchange for goods or services. Cryptocurrencies do not typically exist in a physical form and are not issued by a single centralized authority.

Blockchain ledgers serve as an underlying technology for cryptocurrency creation in a decentralized environment. Blockchain protocols use rigorous cryptography techniques to enable the minting (creation) of cryptocurrency and to secure and verify crypto ownership and fund movement records. The price of cryptocurrency is not controlled by the government or centralized financial institutions. It is defined by its value, correlation to real-world figures, and is driven by market supply and demand.

There exist many different blockchain ledgers, such as Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Tron, and many more. You can investigate different cryptocurrencies and learn about their ledgers using such sources as [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/prices), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk20) to name a few.

### Ada, lovelace, and native tokens

Each blockchain ledger has its underlying cryptocurrency - the ledger’s native currency.

Ada is Cardano’s native currency - the principal currency. This means that ada is the main payment unit on Cardano; it is accepted as fee-payment, to make deposits, and is also the only currency in which rewards are distributed.

Lovelace is the smallest denomination of ada. One ada = 1,000,000 lovelaces. Ada has 6 decimal places, which makes it easily divisible into smaller fractions.

Cardano also supports the creation of native tokens ‒ digital assets that are created for specific purposes. This means that users, developers, and businesses can use the Cardano blockchain to create tokens that represent a footprint of value (whether defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity). A token can be fungible or non-fungible, and act as a payment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder.
